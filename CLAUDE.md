# FortiCNAPP AWS Cloud Security Assessment Guide

Documentation repo for FortiCNAPP Cloud Security Assessment setup on AWS.

## Writing Conventions

### External Links

All links to external docs or external repos must open in a new tab. Use HTML anchor tags instead of markdown links:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Link text</a>
```

Do not use markdown links for external URLs:

```markdown
<!-- Don't do this for external links -->
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

Internal anchor links within the same page remain as standard markdown:

```markdown
[Section name](#section-name)
```
